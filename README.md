We got the data from webscraping on Booking's search pages (for strictly research focused purposes). Afterwards we processed and analyzed this data further to determine whether La Mercè festivities in Barcelona are correlated with fluctuations on Barcelona's hotels' prices.

Please do check that the geckodriver version and the ublock origin extension are the correct versions for your computer to run the code. In case you're having problems running the ublock extension, it can be easily kept out of the code as its part was not really used in the final solution used and it was kept in the repository only for completeness.
